## Contributions
* We propose to **decompose time series into global patterns and local variations according to ranges**. We identify that global patterns as the focus of long range and local variations should be captured in short range.
* To effectively capture long-term patterns and short-term variations, we leverage the patching to create coarser PTS in long range and finer PTS in short range. Moreover, we introduce **a new metric to precisely quantify the resolution of PTS**.
* We propose a **novel hybrid Mamba-Transformer experts architecture SST**, with Mamba as a global patterns expert in long range, and LWT as a local variations expert in short range. A long-short router is designed to adaptively integrate the global patterns and local variations. **With Mamba and LWT, SST is highly scalable with linear complexity O(L) on time series length L**.

## Getting Started
### Environment
* python            3.10.13
* torch             1.12.1+cu116
* mamba-ssm         1.2.0.post1
* numpy             1.26.4
* transformers      4.38.2

The installation of mamba-ssm package can refer to https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba. 

### Run
To run SST on various dataset, run corrrsponidng dataset `.sh` files in the scripts folder. 

For exmaple, run SST on the Weather dataset: `./weather.sh`

### Dataset
You can download all the datasets from the "[Autoformer](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZOYpTUa82_jCcxIdTmyr0LXQfvaM9vIy)" project. Creatae a `dataset` folder in the current directory and put the downloaded datasets into `dataset` folder.
